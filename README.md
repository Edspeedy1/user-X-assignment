This project is a Java-based interactive fish tank simulation created with Processing. With AI-driven behaviours including wandering, food seeking, obstacle avoidance, and evading predators (the mouse). Simply move the mouse around the screen to see the fish try to evade it, or left click to create food at the cursor and move the mouse away to watch the fish swim towards the food.

## Installation
1. Download and Install Processing.
2. Create a new sketch folder.
3. Copy all .pde files and the fishpics/ folder into that sketch folder. (Can use the git clone command)
4. Open Fish_Sketch.pde in Processing.
5. Press Run to start simulation.

   Alexy Pichette - worked on getting the pictures rendering, also updated the code to allow fish to move in any direction,
                    added resctrictions so fish dont go through border or rocks, added feature of food being made while clicked on (fish eat food)

   Eric De Leenheer - made the fish images, as well as images for the background and obsticals, built out the initial framework and did most of the setup
                      like creating the fish and obstical arrays, made the different fish movement patterens and reduced some of the fish's jittering. 

  Vandan Patel - worked on giving the fish a direction vector for more natural acceleration and reducing their over all jittering, also worked
                 on having the fish avoid the cursor and fixed some of the fish's brain logic.
